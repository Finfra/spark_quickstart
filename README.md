## Spark cluster with metrics

![Spark Metrics Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudurable/spark-cluster/master/images/spark-metric-dashboard.png)


Sample spark cluster, that uses systemd, ansible, centos7, influxdb, statsd, spark metrics system, spark job server and more to demonstrate how to collect metrics for perf tuning on a dev cluster.

This projects includes template done in Vagrant and Ansible.

You should be able to take this and apply it to your server machines quickly.

The OS is Centos7 which seems like de facto.

The templates and scripts install Spark, Java, configures spark metrics system, spark job history server, ansible, influxdb, telegraf, chronograf and statsd.

With chronograf, it is easy to setup metrics dashboards too. You could also
set up grafana to display metrics.

Metrics are available via the InfluxDB rest API and the Spark metric system REST API.

It would be easy to write an adapter to send metrics to a custom metric system. Between InfluxDB and Telegraf, most industry standard metric outputs and metric inputs are available.

The metrics are rich and plentiful enough to find and track any problems with a Spark system.

Ansible can be run against real servers as long as you have ssh access. There
are examples installing keys and setting up ssh/ansible.

The trick is automating the system so you can set it up quickly.

To facilitate set up, we use Vagrant. Whenever possible, we use systemd.

Vagrant, ansible, etc. are all installable via brew.

Note we use Vagrant to do local testing. For EC2 or other clouds we would use Terraform instead.


## Setting up your spark cluster with metrics

### Install ansible and vagrant.

#### installing vagrant
##### by Apt
```
$ apt install -y virtualbox
$ apt install -y vagrant
```

##### by Brew
```
$ brew cask install virtualbox
$ brew cask install vagrant
```

See [install vagrant with brew for more details](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Vagrant/README.html).

#### installing ansible

##### by Apt
```
$ apt install -y ansible
```

##### by Brew
```bash
$ brew install ansible
```

### Pull this project down from github

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudurable/spark-cluster.git
$ cd spark-cluster
```


### Run doAll.sh to install spark cluster and etc by ansible

Vagrant up will bring up all of the server.

```bash
./doAll.sh
```

### Contents of doAll.sh 
* if you exected "./doAll.sh", you don't needs to execute below script  


#### Set up keys for ssh for spark cluster

We generate keys for using ssh and ansible.  

```bash
bin/gen-key.sh
```

#### Run download.sh to download spark.

We have a script that downloads spark.
You can customize this script to download a different version of spark.

```bash
bin/download.sh
```

The download uses this [spark dist](
http://apache.spinellicreations.com/spark/spark-2.3.0/spark-2.4.4-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz), you are free to change it.


#### Run vagrant up to bring up the spark nodes

Vagrant up will bring up all of the server.

```bash
vagrant up
```

#### Add keys to your auth known_hosts

After you bring up the servers, you can use `ssh-keyscan` to avoid any issues
with `known_hosts` when using `ansible`.


In order for that keyscan to work, you need the hostnames for the cluster in your /etc/hosts file as follows:


##### Add nodes to your /etc/hosts file for connivence.
```bash
cat >> /etc/hosts <<EOL

192.168.50.20  bastion

192.168.50.4  node0
192.168.50.5  node1
192.168.50.6  node2
192.168.50.7  node3
192.168.50.8  node4
192.168.50.9  node5
EOL
```

##### Add known_hosts to avoid ansible issues.
```bash
ssh-keyscan node0 node1 node2  bastion > ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

#### Ensure all of the servers are up

You can use the ansible ping module to ensure the servers are up.

```
ansible nodes  -m ping
node2 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node0 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node1 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

Ignore any errors you see from bastion. It is place holder.


#### Add keys to the spark nodes

You can add keys to all of the nodes so you can ssh into them from other nodes
in the cluster.

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/keyscan.yml
```

#### Install Spark Servers, prerequisites, and TICK stack
```bash
./doAnsiblePlaybook.sh
```

or

```bash
# Install Java JDK and command line utils
ansible-playbook playbooks/yum-nodes.yml
# Install the Spark master node on node0
ansible-playbook playbooks/install-spark-master.yml
# Install the Spark slave nodes on node1 and node2
ansible-playbook playbooks/install-spark-slave.yml
# Install the Spark history job server on node0
ansible-playbook playbooks/install-spark-history.yml
# Install the telegraf on all nodes but statsD input on node1
ansible-playbook playbooks/install-telegraf.yml
# Configure Spark Metrics system to output to systemd
ansible-playbook playbooks/configure-metrics.yml
# Install the influxdb and chronograf on node2
ansible-playbook playbooks/install-influxdb.yml
```


### Setup Chronograf

Go to Chronograf http://node2:8888

* Set `Connection String` to http://node2:8086
* Set `Name` to Spark
* Leaver UserName and Password blank (you would need to set this in influxdb.conf)
* Set `Telegraf Database` to spark
* Click `Add Connection`
* Create a dashboard and add desired metrics to it


## Spark server layout

This spark cluster is designed to run on a MacBook pro with 16GB.

There are three nodes in this system.

* node0
* node1
* node2

These nodes all run Spark slaves.

They also run some extra servers as follows
* node0 - spark master, spark history server, spark slave
* node1 - spark slave, telegraf statsd server
* node2 - spark slave, InfluxDB, Chronograf

Servers and ports
* [Node 0 Spark Master Server http://node0:8080/](http://node0:8080/)
* [Node 0 History Server http://node0:18080/](http://node0:18080/)
* [Node 2 Chronograf http://node2:8888](http://node2:8888)
* [Node 0 Slave http://node0:8081/](http://node0:8081/)
* [Node 1 Slave http://node1:8081/](http://node1:8081/)
* [Node 2 Slave http://node2:8081/](http://node2:8081/)
* Node 1 StatsD Server udp://node1:8125
* Node 2 InfluxDB input udp://node2:8089
* [Node 2 Influxdb http://node2:8086/ping](http://node2:8086/ping) `curl -v http://node2:8086/ping`

In the real world, these would all run potentially on different servers.

For development and performance tuning locally, we will run them here.


### Commands I use often to debug

```bash
# See Java processes
ps -ef | grep java

# Kill java processes
pkill java #systemd will restart spark services

# See status of spark slave node
systemctl status spark-slave

# See status of spark master
systemctl status spark-master

# See status of spark history server
systemctl status spark-history

# Clear Logs
rm -rf /opt/spark/logs/*
systemctl restart spark-master
systemctl restart spark-slave
systemctl restart spark-history

# Show logs
ls /opt/spark/logs/
 spark-spark-org.apache.spark.deploy.history.HistoryServer-1-node0.out
 spark-spark-org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master-1-node0.out
 spark-spark-org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker-1-node0.out

 # Tail history log
 tail -f /opt/spark/logs/spark-spark-org.apache.spark.deploy.history.HistoryServer-1-node0.out

 # Tail master log
 tail -f  /opt/spark/logs/spark-spark-org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master-1-node0.out

 # Tail worker log
 tail -f /opt/spark/logs/spark-spark-org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker-1-node0.out
```

## Install notes, not instructions just notes

This section is not anything you have to do, it is what the above scripts did to install this cluster.


### Notes: We use Untar to untar the spark distro

```bash
tar xvzf spark.tgz
```

### Spark Install directory

To install spark we do this.

```
mkdir -p /opt/
mv spark-2.4.4-bin-hadoop2.7/ /opt/spark
ls /opt/spark/
```
This is done by an ansible playbook.

See [spark standalone set up for more details](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html).

Next we want to edit the  `/opt/spark/conf/spark-env.sh` (see spark-env.sh.template)

```
SPARK_LOCAL_IP=192.168.50.6
SPARK_PUBLIC_DNS=node2
SPARK_MASTER_HOST=node2
```

The above is automated with ansible and jinja.


#### Notes: To run the master

Then we can run the master.

```bash

/opt/spark/sbin/start-master.sh

```

Note we run the master via ansible and systemd.



### tail the log of the spark master

We can also tail the log of the master.
```
tail -f  /var/spark/logs/spark-root-org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master-1-localhost.localdomain.out

```

### Output
```
org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master --host localhost --port 7077 --webui-port 8080

```
### Go to browser

We can see that the master is running.
At this point spark is running.

Go to http://192.168.50.6:8080/


Then See URLs on this page as follows:

```
URL: spark://localhost:7077
REST URL: spark://localhost:6066 (cluster mode)
```

## Notes Log into another node

Install Spark here.

Connect a worker to the master.

```bash
/opt/spark/sbin/start-slave.sh spark://192.168.50.6:7077
```

## Notes Slaves file

```

cat slaves

```

To visualize the DAGS and see job / worker/ application metrics, we will want the [spark job history server](https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-apache-spark/content/spark-history-server.html).


## Running jobs to see / generate metrics

To see metrics, we will want to run some jobs.

Run SparkPi example with enable log true (for history server).

```bash

 /opt/spark/bin/spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
 --master spark://node0:7077 \
 --conf spark.eventLog.enabled=true \
 /opt/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.11-2.3.0.jar
```

Run SparkPageRank example with enable log true (for history server).

```bash

/opt/spark/bin/spark-submit \
  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPageRank \
  --master spark://node0:7077 \
  --conf spark.eventLog.enabled=true \
  /opt/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.11-2.3.0.jar \
  /opt/spark/data/mllib/pagerank_data.txt 20 &
```

```bash

/opt/spark/bin/spark-submit \
  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPageRank \
  --master spark://node0:6066 \
  --deploy-mode cluster \
  --conf spark.eventLog.enabled=true \
  /opt/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.11-2.3.0.jar \
  /opt/spark/data/mllib/pagerank_data.txt 20 &
```


## Spark Job History Server
With the Spark Job History server we can track metrics.

You run the history server using this command.

```bash
 /opt/spark/sbin/start-history-server.sh
```

We install this with an ansible playbook.

With the history server running, it should be easy to track time for serialization, scheduler and more.

* Scheduler Delay
* Task Deserialization Time
* Result Serialization Time
* Getting Result Time
* Peak Execution Memory

This will tell us where any bottlenecks occur.

### Spark metrics

Spark has an internal metrics system based on [Yammer metrics (now Code Hale Metrics or DropWizard metrics)](http://metrics.dropwizard.io/4.0.0/).

Spark allows metrics to be sent from various sources to one more sinks.

The instance which provide sources are:
* "master"
* "worker"
* "executor"
* "driver"
* "applications"

A wildcard `"*"` denotes all sources inherits the property config.

Within an instance, a "source" specifies a grouped source of related metrics.

Spark Internal sources to track internal state are as follows:
* MasterSource
* WorkerSource
* DAGSchedulerSource
* ApplicationSource
* CacheMetrics
* CodegenMetrics
* possibly more

System sources:
* JvmSource (for JVM metrics)


Sinks are where metrics and KPIs get delivered to (StatsD, JMX, file).

To specify metrics use `"spark.metrics.conf=${SPARK_HOME}/conf/metrics.properties"`
If you put the metrics file in ${SPARK_HOME}/conf it gets loaded automatically.

`MetricsServlet sink` is added by default as a sink in the master, worker and driver. Just send HTTP requests to the "/metrics/json" to get a snapshot of metrics.

Use "/metrics/master/json" and "/metrics/applications/json" endpoints to the master node.

### Curling master for metrics for master

Since MetricsServlet is built-in and on by default you can curl it to see metrics.


#### Curling Spark for metrics
```bash

curl http://node0:8080/metrics/master/json/ | jq
"
  "version": "3.1.3",
  "gauges": {
    "master.aliveWorkers": {
      "value": 3
    },
    "master.apps": {
      "value": 0
    },
    "master.waitingApps": {
      "value": 0
    },
    "master.workers": {
      "value": 3
    }
    "
```

### Curling master for applications

```bash
curl http://node0:8080/metrics/applications/json/ | jq
"
{
  "version": "3.1.3",
  "gauges": {
    "application.Spark Pi.1521748826010.cores": {
      "value": 12
    },
    "application.Spark Pi.1521748826010.runtime_ms": {
      "value": 3700
    },
    "application.Spark Pi.1521748826010.status": {
      "value": "FINISHED"
    },
    "application.Spark Pi.1521748914505.cores": {
      "value": 12
    },
"
```

#### Curling worker for metrics

The default path is `/metrics/json` for all instances except the master which was shown earlier. (Recall Master has `/metrics/applications/json` for apps and `/metrics/master/json`
for master).


```bash
$ curl  http://node1:8081/metrics/json/ | jq
...
"
{
  "version": "3.1.3",
  "gauges": {
    "worker.coresFree": {
      "value": 4
    },
    "worker.coresUsed": {
      "value": 0
    },
    "worker.executors": {
      "value": 0
    },
    "worker.memFree_MB": {
      "value": 1844
    },
    "worker.memUsed_MB": {
      "value": 0
    }
  },
  "counters": {
    "HiveExternalCatalog.fileCacheHits": {
      "count": 0
    },
"    
```

### List of available sinks in metrics.properties

The built-in sinks are as follows:

* ConsoleSink
* CSVSink
* GangliaSink
* JmxSink
* GraphiteSink
* StatsdSink

You can configure more sinks as follows:

#### Spark metrics sink setup

```


### Examples spark stats metrics config

To enable Enable `JmxSink` for all instances use this config.

```bash
*.sink.jmx.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.JmxSink
```

To enable `ConsoleSink` for all instances by class name use

```bash
*.sink.console.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.ConsoleSink
```


To enable StatsdSink for all instances by class name

```bash
*.sink.statsd.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.StatsdSink
*.sink.statsd.prefix=spark
```

You can also set poll period for various sinks.

Here we set the polling period for ConsoleSink.

```bash
# Polling period for the ConsoleSink
*.sink.console.period=10
# Unit of the polling period for the ConsoleSink
*.sink.console.unit=seconds
```

Here we set the polling period for ConsoleSink but only for master.

```bash
# Polling period for the ConsoleSink specific for the master instance
master.sink.console.period=15
# Unit of the polling period for the ConsoleSink specific for the master
# instance
master.sink.console.unit=seconds
```

To enable JvmSource for master, worker and driver we would do the following:

```bash
# Enable JvmSource for instance master, worker, driver and executor
master.source.jvm.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource
worker.source.jvm.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource
driver.source.jvm.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource
executor.source.jvm.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource
```

### Sample metrics config metrics.properties

We plan on using InfluxDB and Telegraf to capture metrics.
Let's set up an example and since we have not installed Telegraf or InfluxDB yet,
let's use the console to capture metrics.

```bash

*.sink.statsd.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.StatsdSink
*.sink.statsd.prefix=spark
*.sink.statsd.port=8125
*.sink.statsd.unit=seconds
*.sink.statsd.period=3
*.sink.statsd.host=node1

*.sink.console.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.ConsoleSink
*.sink.console.period=3
*.sink.console.seconds=seconds

master.source.jvm.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource
worker.source.jvm.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource
driver.source.jvm.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource
executor.source.jvm.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource
```

#### Sample console metrics output log

Here is a sample spark metrics output from using the above config.

```bash

[[inputs.linux_sysctl_fs]]

```

The above telegraf setup captures most of the important operating systems bits.



Telegraf also has a statsD input which we use.
We send the Spark Metrics to the Telegraf input.
Then all of the OS metrics and the statsD Spark metrics go into InfluxDB.

The InfluxDB configuration is as follows:

#### influxdb.conf

```bash

[meta]
  # Where the metadata/raft database is stored
  dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/meta"

[data]
  # The directory where the TSM storage engine stores TSM files.
  dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/data"

  # The directory where the TSM storage engine stores WAL files.
  wal-dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/wal"

  # Trace logging provides more verbose output around the tsm engine. Turning
  # this on can provide more useful output for debugging tsm engine issues.
  trace-logging-enabled = true

  # Whether queries should be logged before execution. Very useful for troubleshooting, but will
  # log any sensitive data contained within a query.
  query-log-enabled = true

  # Settings for the TSM engine

  # CacheMaxMemorySize is the maximum size a shard's cache can
  # reach before it starts rejecting writes.
  # Valid size suffixes are k, m, or g (case insensitive, 1024 = 1k).
  # Vaues without a size suffix are in bytes.
  # cache-max-memory-size = "1g"

  # CacheSnapshotMemorySize is the size at which the engine will
  # snapshot the cache and write it to a TSM file, freeing up memory
  # Valid size suffixes are k, m, or g (case insensitive, 1024 = 1k).
  # Values without a size suffix are in bytes.
  # cache-snapshot-memory-size = "25m"

  # CacheSnapshotWriteColdDuration is the length of time at
  # which the engine will snapshot the cache and write it to
  # a new TSM file if the shard hasn't received writes or deletes
  # cache-snapshot-write-cold-duration = "10m"

  # CompactFullWriteColdDuration is the duration at which the engine
  # will compact all TSM files in a shard if it hasn't received a
  # write or delete
  # compact-full-write-cold-duration = "4h"

  # The maximum number of concurrent full and level compactions that can run at one time.  A
  # value of 0 results in 50% of runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0) used at runtime.  Any number greater
  # than 0 limits compactions to that value.  This setting does not apply
  # to cache snapshotting.
  # max-concurrent-compactions = 0

  # The maximum series allowed per database before writes are dropped.  This limit can prevent
  # high cardinality issues at the database level.  This limit can be disabled by setting it to
  # 0.
  # max-series-per-database = 1000000

  # The maximum number of tag values per tag that are allowed before writes are dropped.  This limit
  # can prevent high cardinality tag values from being written to a measurement.  This limit can be
  # disabled by setting it to 0.
  # max-values-per-tag = 100000

###
### [retention]
###
### Controls the enforcement of retention policies for evicting old data.
###

[retention]
  # Determines whether retention policy enforcement enabled.
  enabled = true

  # The interval of time when retention policy enforcement checks run.
  check-interval = "30m"

###
### Controls the system self-monitoring, statistics and diagnostics.
###
### The internal database for monitoring data is created automatically if
### if it does not already exist. The target retention within this database
### is called 'monitor' and is also created with a retention period of 7 days
### and a replication factor of 1, if it does not exist. In all cases the
### this retention policy is configured as the default for the database.

[monitor]
  # Whether to record statistics internally.
  store-enabled = true

  # The destination database for recorded statistics
  store-database = "_internal"

  # The interval at which to record statistics
  store-interval = "10s"

###
### [http]
###
### Controls how the HTTP endpoints are configured. These are the primary
### mechanism for getting data into and out of InfluxDB.
###

[http]
  # Determines whether HTTP endpoint is enabled.
  enabled = true

  # The bind address used by the HTTP service.
  bind-address = ":8086"

  # Determines whether user authentication is enabled over HTTP/HTTPS.
  auth-enabled = false

  # The default realm sent back when issuing a basic auth challenge.
  realm = "InfluxDB"

  # Determines whether HTTP request logging is enabled.
  log-enabled = true

  # When HTTP request logging is enabled, this option specifies the path where
  # log entries should be written. If unspecified, the default is to write to stderr, which
  # intermingles HTTP logs with internal InfluxDB logging.
  #
  # If influxd is unable to access the specified path, it will log an error and fall back to writing
  # the request log to stderr.
  access-log-path = ""

  # Determines whether detailed write logging is enabled.
  write-tracing = false

  # Determines whether the pprof endpoint is enabled.  This endpoint is used for
  # troubleshooting and monitoring.
  # pprof-enabled = true

  # Determines whether HTTPS is enabled.
  https-enabled = false

  # The SSL certificate to use when HTTPS is enabled.
  # https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb.pem"

  # Use a separate private key location.
  # https-private-key = ""

  # The JWT auth shared secret to validate requests using JSON web tokens.
  # shared-secret = ""

  # The default chunk size for result sets that should be chunked.
  # max-row-limit = 0

  # The maximum number of HTTP connections that may be open at once.  New connections that
  # would exceed this limit are dropped.  Setting this value to 0 disables the limit.
  # max-connection-limit = 0

  # Enable http service over unix domain socket
  # unix-socket-enabled = false

  # The path of the unix domain socket.
  # bind-socket = "/var/run/influxdb.sock"

  # The maximum size of a client request body, in bytes. Setting this value to 0 disables the limit.
  # max-body-size = 25000000


###
### [ifql]
###
### Configures the ifql RPC API.
###

[ifql]
  # Determines whether the RPC service is enabled.
  # enabled = true

  # Determines whether additional logging is enabled.
  # log-enabled = true

  # The bind address used by the ifql RPC service.
  # bind-address = ":8082"


###
### [logging]
###
### Controls how the logger emits logs to the output.
###

[logging]
  # Determines which log encoder to use for logs. Available options
  # are auto, logfmt, and json. auto will use a more a more user-friendly
  # output format if the output terminal is a TTY, but the format is not as
  # easily machine-readable. When the output is a non-TTY, auto will use
  # logfmt.
  # format = "auto"

  # Determines which level of logs will be emitted. The available levels
  # are error, warn, info, and debug. Logs that are equal to or above the
  # specified level will be emitted.
  # level = "info"

  # Suppresses the logo output that is printed when the program is started.
  # The logo is always suppressed if STDOUT is not a TTY.
  # suppress-logo = false

###
### [subscriber]
###
### Controls the subscriptions, which can be used to fork a copy of all data
### received by the InfluxDB host.
###

[subscriber]
  # Determines whether the subscriber service is enabled.
  # enabled = true

  # The default timeout for HTTP writes to subscribers.
  # http-timeout = "30s"

  # Allows insecure HTTPS connections to subscribers.  This is useful when testing with self-
  # signed certificates.
  # insecure-skip-verify = false

  # The path to the PEM encoded CA certs file. If the empty string, the default system certs will be used
  # ca-certs = ""

  # The number of writer goroutines processing the write channel.
  # write-concurrency = 40

  # The number of in-flight writes buffered in the write channel.
  # write-buffer-size = 1000


###
### [[udp]]
###
### Controls the listeners for InfluxDB line protocol data via UDP.
###

[[udp]]
  enabled = true
  bind-address = "node2:8089"
  # database = "udp"
  # retention-policy = ""

  # These next lines control how batching works. You should have this enabled
  # otherwise you could get dropped metrics or poor performance. Batching
  # will buffer points in memory if you have many coming in.

  # Flush if this many points get buffered
  # batch-size = 5000

  # Number of batches that may be pending in memory
  # batch-pending = 10

  # Will flush at least this often even if we haven't hit buffer limit
  # batch-timeout = "1s"

  # UDP Read buffer size, 0 means OS default. UDP listener will fail if set above OS max.
  # read-buffer = 0

###
### [continuous_queries]
###
### Controls how continuous queries are run within InfluxDB.
###

[continuous_queries]
  # Determines whether the continuous query service is enabled.
  # enabled = true

  # Controls whether queries are logged when executed by the CQ service.
  # log-enabled = true

  # Controls whether queries are logged to the self-monitoring data store.
  # query-stats-enabled = false

  # interval for how often continuous queries will be checked if they need to run
  # run-interval = "1s"

```

The spark metrics system is outputting StatsD to Telegraf which is inputting those metrics to InfluxDB.

#### /opt/spark/conf/metrics.properties

```bash

*.sink.statsd.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.StatsdSink
*.sink.statsd.prefix=spark
*.sink.statsd.port=8125
*.sink.statsd.unit=seconds
*.sink.statsd.period=3
*.sink.statsd.host=localhost

*.sink.console.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.ConsoleSink
*.sink.console.period=3
*.sink.console.seconds=seconds

master.source.jvm.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource

driver.source.jvm.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource
executor.source.jvm.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource

```

### Systemd

Everywhere when possible we use Systemd to manage background servers.
Systemd will ensure that the servers keep running.
We install the Spark processes as services that will boot up when the server boots up.

#### System for Spark Slave service

```bash
